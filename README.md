# Opensight

## What is Opensight
Opensight is an Application Monitoring Software, and should be a better alternative to other analytics and Application Monitoring Software. You are able to host it On-Premis, or in the cloud managed by Opensight.

We support features like: 

- Performance Monitoring
- Error analysis
- Event-Tracking
- Device and User analytics

## How does it work
Opensight consists out of 2 parts, the Client and the Backend. The Backend is build in an microservice-architecture, the advantages of that is, if you dont want to use the whole Opensight-Stack you are free to choose which services you like, and dont need to pay for unused features.
