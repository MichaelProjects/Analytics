Currently we dont offer a prebuild version of the Dashboard, so you need to edit the config with the deployed services (like: core-service...).

1. The first step is to clone the repo with the dashboard:
```bash
git clone MichaelProjects/opensight
cd opensight/dashboard
```
2. edit the example config file that is located dashboard/lib, after you finished editing the config file, the file will be renamed to config.dart:
```bash
nano example_conf.dart && mv example_conf.dart config.dart
```
3. Now you are ready to build the application, if you want to build a static website you need to have installed flutter & dart
```bash
flutter build web --release
```
After the command is finished you can simply go into the build/ folder and copy the web folder to your dashboard host server.


Alternative: 
If you want to build and deploy it in a docker container you can simply run:
```bash
docker build -t your_registry/dashboard .
```
