### Deploy 
We offer a prebuild docker container that contains only the analytic service.

But before we start with the deployment of the analytic-service we need to specific a config file containing the database credentails and other parameters.

1. First we get the an exmaple config file:
```bash
wget -O analytic_conf.toml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichaelProjects/opensight/dev/analytics_api/example_conf.toml 
```
Please change to port to 28018. Also specify the database credentials and the FQDN the core service is able to communicate with it.

2. Now we edit the config file:
```bash
nano analytic_conf.toml
```
3. Now we can start the analytic-service:
```bash
docker pull michaellichtenecker/opensight_analytic:latest
docker run -v $pwd/analytic_conf.toml:/conf.toml -p 0.0.0.0:28018:28018 michaellichtenecker/opensight_analytic:latest 
```
This command mounts your config file into the container and start to listen publicly on port 28019. Its accessible from the internet.
