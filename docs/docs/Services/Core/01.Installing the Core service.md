### Deploy 
We offer a prebuild docker container that contains only the core service.

But before we start with the deployment of the core-service we need to specific a config file containing the database credentails and other parameters.

1. First we get the an exmaple config file:
```bash
wget -O core_conf.toml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichaelProjects/opensight/dev/core/example_conf.toml&& mv test_conf.toml conf.toml
```
2. Now we edit the config file:
```bash
nano core_conf.toml
```
3. Now we can start the core service:
```bash
docker pull michaellichtenecker/opensight_core:latest
docker run -v $pwd/core_conf.toml:/conf.toml -p 0.0.0.0:28019:28019 michaellichtenecker/opensight_core:latest 
```
This command mounts your config file into the container and start to listen publicly on port 28019. Its accessible from the internet.
