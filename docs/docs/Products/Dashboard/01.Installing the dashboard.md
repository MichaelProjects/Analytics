:::tip
Before you deploy anything please read the Opensight Stack documentation to understand how the whole stack works together.
:::

Docker version:
1. Pull the docker image
```bash
docker pull opensight/opensight-dashboard:latest
```

2. Start the container
```bash
docker run -e OPENSIGHT_CORE_URL="https://corehost.de" -it -d -p 0.0.0.0:8080:80 michaellichtenecker/opensight_dashboard:latest
```


:::note
Or you could build the dashboard from source and deploy without docker.
:::


1. The first step is to clone the repo with the dashboard:
```bash
git clone MichaelProjects/opensight
cd opensight/dashboard
```
2. After the command is finished you need to create a ".env" file.
```bash 
touch assets/.env
nano assets/.env
```
:::note
On the next site we will show you, how you set the values for the .env file.
:::
3. Now you are ready to build the application, if you want to build a static website you need to have flutter & dart installed.
```bash
flutter build web --release
```

4. to deploy the application you could simply run:
```bash
scp -r build/web:root@yourstaticwebsitehost.com:/srv/websites/metrics.yourcompany.com
```

So now where finished, you build a static website and now you can deploy it via nginx or anything else on your website host server.
