:::tip
Before you deploy anything please read the Opensight Stack documentation to understand how the whole stack works together.
:::

Currently we dont offer a prebuild version of the Dashboard, so you need to edit the config with the deployed services (like: core-service...).

1. The first step is to clone the repo with the dashboard:
```bash
git clone MichaelProjects/opensight
cd opensight/dashboard
```
2. Now you are ready to build the application, if you want to build a static website you need to have flutter & dart installed.
```bash
flutter build web --release
```
3. After the command is finished you need to create a ".env" file.
```bash 
touch build/web/.env
```
:::note
On the next site we will show you how you set the values for the .env file.
:::
4. to deploy the application you could simply run:
```bash
scp -r build/web:root@yourstaticwebsitehost.com:/srv/websites/metrics.yourcompany.com
```

So now where finished, you build a static website and now you can deploy it via nginx or anything else on your website host server.
