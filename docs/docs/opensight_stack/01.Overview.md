Opensight consists of multiple microservices to offer great modularity and save resources. But to support this architecture we need a "Manager" to manage the microservices. In our case the core-service is the center of the application and needs to be ***always*** deployed.

### Architecture
To get an understanding of how the Opensight-Stack works, we will show you the architecture of the Opensight.

In this example, we gave each "service-group" its own database to increase the independence and reduce the database load.

:::note
Alternatively you could also use ***one*** database for all services. But this could decrease the performance of the whole stack.

### Services
So we already talked about the core service, but there is more service that enables you different functionalities.
