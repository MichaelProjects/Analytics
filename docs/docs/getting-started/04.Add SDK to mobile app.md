Now lets integrate the client sdk into your mobile application. This example used flutter.

1. First decide which modules you want to integrate into your app. In our case we install the analytic service.
2. Next step would be to add the  module from [pub.dev](http://pub.dev/) to your pubspec.yml file.
The [analytic package](https://pub.dev/packages/opensight_analytics)

3. Now we need to initialize an app instance in the main method of the application

```dart
void main() {
    WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
    OpensightAnalytics().initApp({
    "url": "http://example.host",
    "app_id": "application_id",
    "name": "name of your app",
    "token": "your_application_token",
    "package_name": "io.app"
  });

    runApp(const MyApp());
}
...
```

4. Now you are ready to go, just run your app and the opensight stack should receive your session data.
