### What is Opensight?
Opensight is a user privacy-focused insight platform that provides developers and business analyst a variety of insights and metrics from their Applications in production without compromising the privacy of their users.

### Why opensight?
There are a variety of analytic or event tracking software, but opensight is an insight platform that delivers a lot more than just analytics or events. But we also wanted to offer a better, more privacy-focused, and transparent alternative to the existing ones. Opensight could be used in two ways. Managed in the cloud by use or you simply run the Opensight Stack on premise. You can also combine both ways for example you host the core service on premise and the analyze service in the cloud.

### Current State
Currently, opensight is in an **early stage of the development**, but we are working hard to make it a fully-featured platform. To find the features we are currently working on, please visit the Roadmap.

### Why an early release?
The goal was to release an early-stage MVP to get a response from the opensource community. What features are important for you and which should be implemented next.
