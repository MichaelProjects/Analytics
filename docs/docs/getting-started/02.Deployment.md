There are two ways to get started with opensight.

1. Get started with a cloud instance of Opensight managed by Opensight. (Coming soon)
2. Host it on premise to try it, just use the quickstart.

## Quickstart
The fastest way to get started with the opensigth stack and to test it out is simply to pull the following docker-compose, change some settings and get it up running.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichaelProjects/opensight/dev/quickstart-compose.yml
docker-compose -f quickstart-compose.yml up --build
```

## Deploy custom setup
We recommend to check out the installtion documentation for each service you want to deploy. They can be found under [Services](/docs/Services/Core/Installing%20the%20Core%20service).
