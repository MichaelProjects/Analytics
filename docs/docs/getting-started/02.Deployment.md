There are two ways to get started with opensight.

1. Get started with a cloud instance of Opensight managed by Opensight. (Coming soon)
2. Host it on premise

## Quickstart
The fastest way to get started with the opensigth stack and to test it out is simply to pull the following docker-compose, change some settings and get it up running.

```bash
wget 
docker-compose -f quickstart-compose.yml up --build
```
